## Features

### Development Modes
- **AI-Driven Development**: Automate story implementation end-to-end using Claude Code — from branching to code generation, review, and merge
- **Human-Driven Development**: Manage your sprint workflow manually with the sprint board, using BMAD agents as assistants rather than full automation

### Sprint Board
- **Sprint Board**: Drag-and-drop stories across columns (Backlog, Ready for Dev, In Progress, Review, Done, Optional)
- **Epic Organization**: Stories grouped by epic with color-coded badges
- **Custom Story Order**: Drag-and-drop ordering within columns, persisted per epic/status
- **Story Details**: View acceptance criteria, tasks, subtasks, and file changes with task toggling
- **Search & Filter**: Find stories by text or filter by epic
- **Collapsible Columns**: Minimize columns with per-epic state persistence
- **Human Review**: Optional review column with configurable checklist items
- **Status History**: Timeline of story status changes with source tracking (user vs agent)

### AI Agent Automation
- **Full Cycle**: One-click end-to-end story processing — creates story file, branches, implements, reviews, commits, and merges with a visual stepper and real-time log
- **Epic Cycle**: Batch-run the full cycle across all backlog stories in an epic with per-story progress tracking
- **Agent Chat**: Sliding sidebar panel with persistent threads, message streaming, typing indicators, and session resume
- **Agent Terminal**: Raw agent output view with ANSI color support and tool call filtering
- **Project Workflows**: Browse and launch available BMAD workflows directly from the UI
- **AI Tool Support**: Claude Code
- **Model Selection**: Choose between Opus and Sonnet
- **Smart Auto-Response**: Orchestrator detects agent prompts and provides intelligent context during automation
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-project LLM API cost ledger displayed in the status bar
- **Verbose Mode**: Toggle detailed tool call information in the chat view

### Project Management
- **Project Wizard**: Guided new project setup with BMAD installation, artifact detection, and template validation
- **Project Switcher**: Quickly switch between recent projects (up to 10)
- **BMAD Scanner**: Auto-discovers agents, workflows, and version info from `_bmad/` directory
- **Version Gate**: Blocks usage with pre-BMAD 6 projects and prompts for upgrade
- **Environment Check**: Verifies required tools (Claude Code CLI, Git) on project open
- **Planning Artifacts**: View epics, goals, and planning documents within the app

### Git Integration
- **Branch Management**: Create, switch, and view branches with last-commit activity timestamps
- **Diff Viewer**: Side-by-side git diff with resizable panel and changed files list
- **Uncommitted Changes**: View modified files in the working directory
- **Merge Support**: Merge story branches to base with merge status checks
- **Configurable Settings**: Base branch (main/master/develop), epic branches, gitignore handling — per-project

### Developer Experience
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Gruvbox-themed toggle
- **Command Palette**: Quick actions via `Cmd/Ctrl+K`
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive shortcuts with `Cmd/Ctrl+/` reference dialog
- **Auto-Refresh**: File watching detects story file changes in real time
- **Auto-Update**: Checks for updates on launch, downloads in background, installs on quit
- **System Notifications**: Native OS notifications for agent messages when app is unfocused
- **Window Persistence**: Remembers window position and size across restarts

### Story Status

Stories use frontmatter to define their status:

```yaml
---
status: ready-for-dev
---
```

Valid statuses: `backlog`, `ready-for-dev`, `in-progress`, `review`, `done`, `optional`

## Development

```bash
npm run dev              # Vite dev server only
npm run electron:dev     # Full Electron app in dev mode
npm run build            # Production build
npm run typecheck        # Type checking
```

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Electron 33
- MUI (Material UI) 6
- Zustand for state management
